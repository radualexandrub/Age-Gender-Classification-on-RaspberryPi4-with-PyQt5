# Real-Time Age and Gender Classification on RaspberryPi4 using TFLite and PyQt5 Interface
Automatic age and gender classification in real-time, using Convolutional Neural Networks (based on MobileNet v1 network), fitted on Raspberry Pi 4 model using a converted .tflite model. The application is wrapped in a simple and modern UI using PyQt5.

## <a name="AboutApp"></a>About this App
Automatic age and gender classification can be used in a large number of applications, especially in intelligent human-computer interfaces, as well as in biometrics, visual surveillance, limited access to multimedia content, and for commercial applications such as self-checkouts.

This app is proposed to be an optimal solution for the classification of age and gender in real-time, using a limited resource platform (Raspberry Pi 4 system), which does not have graphical acceleration. The app uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in order to predict the classes. The network used is MobileNet v1 with 4 Million parameters, which is optimal in terms of resources used (compared to other CNN networks, see the table I made below).

This was a small part of my final project to obtain my Bachelor's Degree at Faculty of Electronics, UPB, Computer Science department. The final grade for the project was 10/10.
